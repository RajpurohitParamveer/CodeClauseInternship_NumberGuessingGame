# NumGuessingGame
I developed a number guessing game with a graphical user interface using Python and the tkinter library. The game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, providing feedback on each guess.
In this project, I developed a simple yet interactive number guessing game using Python and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, encouraging the user to keep guessing until they find the correct number. This project helped me enhance my programming skills and learn more about GUI development in Python.

Libraries Used:
1.random
  Used for generating a random number that the user has to guess.

2.tkinter
  A standard Python library for creating GUIs.
  Used to create the main application window, input fields, buttons, and labels for user interaction.

3.tkinter.messagebox
  Used to display error messages and success notifications to the user.

What I Learned
1.Random Number Generation:
  Learned how to generate random numbers within a specified range using Python's random module.
  
2..User Input Handling:
  Gained experience in capturing and validating user input from GUI components.
  Implemented error handling to manage invalid inputs effectively.

3.Conditional Statements:
  Applied conditional logic to compare the user's guess with the generated random number and provide appropriate feedback.

4.Graphical User Interface Development:
  Learned how to use the tkinter library to create a simple but functional GUI.
  Implemented various GUI components such as labels, entry widgets, and buttons.
  Managed the layout and user interactions within the application.

5.Event-Driven Programming:
  Understood the basics of event-driven programming by linking button clicks to specific functions.
  Enhanced my skills in writing clean and modular code for better maintainability.

By working on this project, I enhanced my problem-solving skills and gained practical experience in developing interactive applications using Python. This project provided a solid foundation for future projects involving GUI development and user interaction.
